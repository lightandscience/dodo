# Raspberry Pico development board footprints

Modified from [here](https://github.com/ncarandini/KiCad-RP-Pico), and thus also under TPCWare KiCaD Licence (see License file).

The original library allows for integration of the Raspberry Pico boards (all 4 variations) onto PCB designs by soldering to the castellations or through-hole pins.

The modified library here aims to reproduce the development board form factor itself (including pin labels, silk screen, etc.) to create variants of the development board.
