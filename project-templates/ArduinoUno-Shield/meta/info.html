<h1>Arduino Uno Shield PCB and footprint</h1>

<p>This template includes a single footprint, where the pinout aligns with 
    the Arduino Uno R3 symbol included with KICAD, and a matching footprint that
    can be used to create an Arduino shield PCB.</p>
    <p>Edge cuts are preset to follow the Arduino shield shape, but can of course be changed.</p>
    <p>Compared to the standard template, this approach allows to use a single symbol in the schematic,
        and prevents pins to be accidentally moved, as they are part of a single footprint.
